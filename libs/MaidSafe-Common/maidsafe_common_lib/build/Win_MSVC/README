Windows Build Instructions - Building With Visual Studio
========================================================

These instructions relate to using Microsoft Visual Studio to build the project.

#  Open a Visual Studio command terminal
#  cd to build dir for Windows with MSVC (build\Win_MSVC)
#  Run cmake ..\..

   This will create an MSVC solution in build\Win_MSVC\ which will allow you to
   make all the targets from within the MSVC IDE.
