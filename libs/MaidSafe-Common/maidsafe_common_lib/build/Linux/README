Linux Build Instructions
========================

#  cd to build dir for Linux matching the build type required (build/Linux/Debug, build/Linux/Release, etc.)
#  Run cmake ../../.. -G"CodeBlocks - Unix Makefiles"
#  Run make (this will make all).  Other options:

    *  Run make Experimental to configure, build, test and upload to our dashboard.
    *  Run make package to create auto rpm or deb.
    *  Run make install to install the maidsafe-dht library to /usr/local/lib and headers to /usr/local/include.
